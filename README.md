# 📣 Turundusjutud Client Onboarding App

This is a **Streamlit** web application designed to streamline the client onboarding process for **Turundusjutud** (Marketing Stories). It serves as an interactive guide for potential Google Ads clients, walking them through the agency's 5-step service framework.

## 🎯 Purpose

The main goal of this app is to educate clients on why the **Audit Phase** is a paid diagnostic service rather than a free sales tool. It replaces static PDF proposals with an interactive, branded web experience.

## 🎨 Brand Identity

The application is styled using custom CSS to match the Turundusjutud brand book:

* **Primary Teal:** `#1A776F` (Headers, Accents)
* **Dark Green:** `#052623` (Sidebar)
* **Orange:** `#FF7F40` (Buttons, Highlights)
* **Background:** `#FAFAFA` (Clean canvas)

## 🚀 Features

* **Interactive Sidebar:** Navigation through 5 distinct onboarding stages.
* **Educational Content:** Explains the difference between a "Sales Audit" and a "Medical/Technical Diagnostic."
* **Responsive Design:** Works on desktop and mobile.
* **Custom Styling:** Overrides default Streamlit styles to match the agency's visual identity.
